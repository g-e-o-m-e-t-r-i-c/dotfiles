### The .config Directory

This directory contains most of the configurations for applications I use.

1. My [i3](https://i3wm.org/docs/), [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar), and [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) configuration.

2. My [neofetch](https://github.com/dylanaraps/neofetch) configuration, with the use of [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com).

3. My [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty) and [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) configuration.

4. My [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/) configuration.

5. My [Neovim](https://neovim.io) configuration.
   _I'm slowly moving to a Lua-based configuration, so there are some inconsistencies with the filetypes._
